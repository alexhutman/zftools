# Zero Forcing Number
This program calculates the zero forcing number (and set) of any graph. The zero forcing number is defined as follows:
>A subset S of initially infected vertices of a graph G is called forcing if we can infect the entire graph by iteratively applying the following process. At each step, any infected vertex which has a unique uninfected neighbour, infects this neighbour. The forcing number of G is the minimum cardinality of a forcing set in G.

## Install from PyPI
```bash
sage -pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ zftools
```

## Install from source
```bash
sage -pip install .
```

## Test
### Install the dependencies for testing
```bash
sage -pip install zftools[test]
```

### Build the wavefront code for verification during tests
```bash
sage --python3 setup.py wavefront
```

### Install the wavefront code we just built
```bash
sage -pip install .
```

### Run the tests
```bash
sage --python3 -m pytest [-x]
```
* `-x` flag makes pytest stop after the first failure
* `-h` flag will show a section called `Zero forcing options:`

## Import
```python
from zftools import *
```

## Building/Running in Docker
1. Download Docker from the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/)
2. Run `docker build -t zftools .` in the directory this git repository is located in
3. Run `docker run --rm -it zftools`
4. The package should be automatically installed inside of the container and Sage should be running. Have fun!
